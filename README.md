ExecExam is a powerful tool that runs executable examinations in which a
student provides solutions to programming problems that are checked by Pytest
test suites. If you are a computer science or software engineering instructor
who wants to administer programming examinations

## üåü Main Features

- **Automated Checks**: Run a series of checks on your Python projects to ensure
they're up to standard.
- **Detailed Reports**: See the results of the checks, including which ones
passed and which ones failed.
- **Advice on Failures**: When code fails a check, receive advice on what to do next.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enjoy syntax highlighting in the console output.
- **Verbose Mode**: Want to see more details? Just enable the verbose mode!

## ü§ù LLM-Based Advice

ExecExam uses the LLM-based advice system to provide students with feedback
when one of their answers fails a check. You can either specify the complete
URL of a LiteLLM API proxy or set an API key for a cloud-based LLM provider.
Here are examples of some of the LLM models that are supported through the use
of [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers):

- `anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- `anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229`
- `groq/llama3-8b-8192`
- `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
